# Google Stitch Prompt for Cabinet App UI Redesign

## Copy and paste this prompt into Google Stitch (https://stitch.withgoogle.com)

---

**Primary Prompt:**
```
Design a professional cabinet design and manufacturing web application with a construction industry aesthetic. The app is called "CABENGINE" and is used by professional cabinet makers to design kitchen layouts, generate bills of materials (BOM), optimize cut patterns, and export construction documents.

The app should have a robust, industrial design language with construction-themed colors:
- Primary: Deep slate gray (#1e293b), dark gray (#0f172a)
- Accent: Amber/orange (#f59e0b) for highlights and CTAs
- Secondary: Light gray (#f1f5f9), white (#ffffff)
- Background: Off-white/light gray (#f8fafc)

Key screens to design:
1. **Home/Dashboard** - Landing screen with project management options
2. **Project Setup** - Configuration screen for new projects with company info, dimensions, and settings
3. **Wall Editor** - Main design workspace with visual cabinet layout editor, drag-and-drop interface, and property panels
4. **BOM Report** - Detailed material lists, cost calculations, and export options
5. **Cut Plan View** - Optimized cutting patterns with material visualization

Design requirements:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Industrial/construction aesthetic with bold typography
- Card-based layouts with subtle shadows
- Icon-based navigation with clear labels
- Data tables with clean typography
- Visual workspace for cabinet layout
- Professional print-friendly layouts
- Dark mode support

Key features to include:
- Drag-and-drop cabinet placement
- Interactive 2D/3D visualizations
- Real-time BOM calculations
- Export options (Excel, PDF, JSON)
- Material optimization displays
- Cost estimation tools

The design should feel like professional CAD/BIM software but modernized for web use, with the reliability and precision expected in construction software.
```

## Additional Refinement Prompts (use after initial generation):

### For Enhanced Navigation:
```
Update the navigation to include a sidebar with these icons: Home (dashboard), Setup (settings), Walls (box design), BOM (table/list), Plan (map/layout). Use the amber color for active states and hover effects.
```

### For the Wall Editor Workspace:
```
Design the wall editor screen with a large canvas area for cabinet placement, a left sidebar for wall/zone management, and a bottom panel for detailed cabinet/obstacle properties. Include drag handles and visual feedback for interactions.
```

### For Data Tables:
```
Create clean, professional data tables with alternating row colors, clear typography, and hover states. Include sorting indicators and filter options. Use monospace font for dimensions and measurements.
```

### For Mobile Optimization:
```
Optimize all screens for mobile devices with collapsible sidebars, touch-friendly controls, and swipe gestures for navigation between screens.

## Instructions for Use:

1. **Go to Google Stitch**: https://stitch.withgoogle.com
2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. **Copy the primary prompt** above and paste it into Stitch
4. **Wait for the initial design** to generate
5. **Use the refinement prompts** to enhance specific areas
6. **Iterate** by asking for specific improvements
7. **Export to Figma** for detailed adjustments
8. **Export code** when ready to implement

## Tips for Best Results:

- Start with the main prompt, then use refinement prompts for specific screens
- Ask Stitch to "show variations" if you want different layout options  
- Use "make it more industrial" or "add more construction aesthetic" for style adjustments
- Request "mobile-first responsive" versions for each screen
- Ask for "export-ready code" when you're satisfied with the design

## Expected Outputs:

Stitch should provide:
- Complete UI mockups for all 5 main screens
- Responsive design variations
- Component library elements
- Interactive prototype capabilities
- Export options to Figma for fine-tuning
- React/HTML code generation

The generated designs will maintain your construction theme while providing a modern, professional interface for your cabinet manufacturing application.
